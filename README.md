# Delhi-Air-Quality-Prediction
Using publicly available datasets, we create a Machine Learning model to better predict PM 2.5 pollutant levels using meteorological data (temperature, wind speed, relative humidity) and day and time for the city of Delhi. You can read more about this project and its implementation in the following series of blogs published on OpenGenus IQ-
